Hey it seems that you completed all our quests and it's almost morning. 
Play the gong, please.

It's our alarm clock, it'll wake up the other monks...
Wait... What am I saying? We are in the prototype, not at the temple, there are no sleeping monks here...

Well... play it anyway, would you? Let's stick to the routine.
