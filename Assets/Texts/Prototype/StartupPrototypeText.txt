Welcome to the prototype!

Before we begin, here's a brief list of keys that you might wanna use:
ARROWS: Move around.
X: Interact.
SPACE: Play.
CTRL: Run.
I: Open items and quest menu.
ESC: Pause game.
M: Mute music.

Also, you'll notice a little progression bar on the top-left corner of your screen. That marks the day progression, at the end of the day you'll have to play the Great Gongâ„¢ to conclude your experience in the prototype.

This is a narrative game, we suggest to pay attention to the dialogues.

HAVE FUN!
