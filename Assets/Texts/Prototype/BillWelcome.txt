Hey, welcome to the prototype. My name is Bill and I exist only to show you how it works around here...

You interacted with me so I assume that you already know what's the key to interact... 
In case you forgot it's X.

Then you can use the arrows to move around, press CTRL to run and SPACE to play the instruments.

Feel free to lurk around, I wouldn't recommend it in our temple but this is the prototype, so do what you want.

There's another monk in the room, his name his Will, feel free to talk to him to get some quests. 

Don't worry they are not particularly demanding, it's just to show you how we treat the interns at the temple.

HAVE FUN!
