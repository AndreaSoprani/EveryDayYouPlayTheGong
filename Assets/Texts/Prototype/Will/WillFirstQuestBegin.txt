Hey, I'm Will, it's a pleasure to meet you!
Let me guess, Bill sent you here, he said something about some quests, right?

Classic Bill, he enrolls for the prototype and then leaves all the work to someone else.
Ok, let's get to the first quest.

Try to play some instruments around here.
Make some noise!

Come back here when you are finished, I'll have something else for you to do.
