Ok, you are finally ready for the last quest: you'll face a labyrinth!

Don't worry, it's an easy one, but you'll find another puzzle at the end of it.

There is another monk that can help you there, his name is Phil. He's a weird guy, kinda like you...

When you'll solve the puzzle the last door will open and you'll find yourself in the Great Gongâ„¢ room.

Play it so that we can end this nightmare of a prototype and go home.
