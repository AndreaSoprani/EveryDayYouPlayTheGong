Hey, welcome to the prototype. Let me introduce myself: my name is Bill.

You see, with this little prototype we'd like to show you how it works at the temple.

Do you see that monk on your right? He's Will, feel free to talk to him to get some quests. 

Don't worry they are not particularly demanding, it's just to show you how we treat the interns at the temple.

Feel free to lurk around, I wouldn't recommend it in our temple but this is the prototype, so do what you want.

See you around!
