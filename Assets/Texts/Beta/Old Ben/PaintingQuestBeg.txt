Welcome, intern!
It's a pleasure to meet you.

I'm the head of the temple, the monks around here usually call me Old Ben, you can call me like that too.

Since you chose to come here, I assume you are interested in the history of the area...

No one really knows the origins of this temple, it was probably built thousands of years ago.

The oldest document that we have is a legend that narrates the destruction of the temple and its reconstruction.

It is said that an ancient monster was unleashed centuries ago and that it destroyed everything around here.

According to the myth, the temple that we inhabit is built on top of the ruins of the old one.

No one knows the truth but I believe there is something interesting in this tale.

By the way, if I recall correctly there's a painting of it in the music room, go and take a close look at it. It's beautiful!
