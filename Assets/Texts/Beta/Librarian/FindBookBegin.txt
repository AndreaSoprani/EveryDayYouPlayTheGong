What is this? A book from the library? Where did you find it?

Oh, it doesn't matter, I'm glad that you found it and returned it.

You know, the monks have this bad habit of not returning books, I hate that!

This one was borrowed by Greg a few months ago. I'm wondering why he left it around

Now that I think about it, there are other books that need to be retrieved.

I would go around the temple and take them back myself but I cannot leave the library. Could you do it for me?

For example there's this one monk who had a book for 2 years now! Could you retrieve it for me?

I donâ€™t know where he hid it, it could be anywhere!

Thank you!
