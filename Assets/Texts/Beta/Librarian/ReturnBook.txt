What is this? A book from the library? Where did you find it?

Oh, it doesn't matter, I'm glad that you found it and returned it.

You know, the monks have this bad habit of not returning books, I hate that!

I would go around the temple and take them back myself but I cannot leave the library. Could you do it for me?

There's this one monk who had a book for 2 years now! Could you sneak into his room and grab it for me?

His room is the second in the east wing of the temple, it's very close to the library.

Thank you!
