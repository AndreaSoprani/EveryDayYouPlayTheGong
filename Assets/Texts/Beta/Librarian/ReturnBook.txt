What is this? A book from the library? Where did you find it?

Oh, it doesn't matter, I'm glad that you found it and returned it.

You know, the monks have this bad habit of not returning books, I hate that!

This one was borrowed by Greg a few months ago.

I'm wondering why he left it around, anyways thank you for your service.
