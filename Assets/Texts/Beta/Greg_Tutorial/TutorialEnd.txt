I'd say you're a talented gong player but I'd be lying.

Anyways, you can come here when you want to make some practice with the other instruments too.

Hey, the sun is rising, time flies when you're having fun, huh?

If you want to know what time is it you can watch that bar on the top left corner of your screen.

If it's filled it's almost dawn, so as you can see it's your time to shine, go and play the Great Gongâ„¢.

You have to do that every time the bar is filled, please don't forget about that.

When you've done that go talk to Old ben, the head of the temple, he'd like to meet you.

I think he has something for you to do but don't take him too seriously, he's an old guy with weird ideas.
