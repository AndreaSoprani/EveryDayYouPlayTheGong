Hey, what are you doing around here? 

Well, since you're here, I need help.

I have to change a light bulb because it's flickering, not right now but it was doing it one second ago.

I need you to take out the electricity for a while, the power box is in the storage closet.

It's the first room on the left in this corridor.

Can you do it for me?
