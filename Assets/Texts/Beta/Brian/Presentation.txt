Hi! You have to be the new intern. I'm Brian, glad to meet you.

The head of the temple sent me here to receive you and to show you around.

First of all, do you see the two doors on our sides? 

On the right you can find the library, there are plenty of books inside.

Geez... I've just recalled that I should have returned a book about 2 years ago!

Now it's clear why the librarian hates me...

Returning to serious things.. The left door instead leads to the music room.

You can go there to practice playing with various instruments.

Now follow me, I'll show you the rest of the temple
