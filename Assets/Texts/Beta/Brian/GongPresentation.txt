This is our beautiful gong. Look at it..

Every time that I see it, a little tear bathes my cheeks.

The job we ask of you it's very important, for ages our lives were punctuated by the sweet sound of our gong.

So please, try not to ruin the magic.

Do yo see the big door behind the gong? That is office of the head of the temple.

Follow me one last time, I've left the best at the end
