Hi there, welcome!

I'm Francis the Great, but my friends call me Francis... So I'm Francis the Great for you.

Let's get to business, I manage the human resources here at the temple, so I must teach you some stuff.

First of all, you can play some instruments with SPACE.

Make some practice with that gong over there so that you'll be ready for the Great Gongâ„¢.
