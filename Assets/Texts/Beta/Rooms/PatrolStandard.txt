Hi, I'm patrolling the area searching for a snacks thief.

I don't know if you know that here at the temple someone is stealing all the unattended snacks.

Don't worry man I'm very close to find that picaroon... The other day I've received a tip from Willy.

He said that he saw Zeder, the bonsai guy, taking a candy from a table.

I trust Willy, he's a good man. He always gives me candies and any type of snacks, he's really into snacks...
