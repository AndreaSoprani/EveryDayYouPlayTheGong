Wait! where have you found that candy???

Oh I see, yesterday I was cleaning my room. Maybe the candy fell from my sleeve.

Can I ask you a favour? Could you please search in the monastery if you find other snacks?

This week I lost 3 snacks: a chocolate bar, a soda can and a chips package.

I'm pretty careless so they could be anywhere. If you won't find anything try to talk to the monks, maybe they took them.
 
I suggest you to start from the garden
