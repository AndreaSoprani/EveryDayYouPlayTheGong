"How do you make a Bonsai tree? The first step is to acquire a tree,
 
which can be done by buying a preBonsai (rough material to be pruned and wired)

or by using one of several possible cultivation techniques. Very important however is to select a tree species 

that fits your circumstances. Are you keen on keeping the tree indoors or would you like to put your Bonsai outside?

In the latter case, most non-tropical trees will grow perfectly fine as long as they are protected from

either intense sunlight or freezing temperatures. A safe bet is to select an indigenous tree species. 

With this short introduction you should be able to select a tree that fits your wishes,

either an indoor Bonsai or an outdoor."
