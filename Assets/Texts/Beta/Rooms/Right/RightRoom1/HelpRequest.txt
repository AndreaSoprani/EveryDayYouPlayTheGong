Wait! where have you found that???

Oh I see, yesterday I was cleaning my room. Maybe the candy fell from my sleeve.

Can I ask you a favour? Could you please search in the temple if you find other snacks?

This week I lost 3 snacks: a chocolate bar, a can of soda and some chips.

I'm pretty disorganized so they could be anywhere. 

If you have trouble finding them try asking the monks, maybe they found something.

I suggest you to start from the garden.
