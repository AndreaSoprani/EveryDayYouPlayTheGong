Hey, Willy asked you to search for his stuff? That's typical of him... He would lose his head if it wasn't attached to his body...

He's very messy and, after the vending machine ban, he started to hide all his snacks fearing confiscation...

By the way, yesterday while I was meditating near the pond I sat on this, maybe it's what you're looking for...

Willy is often in the library, I suggest you to search there if you need to find other stuff.

Oh I almost forgot! Lately I also saw Willy in the east corridor fumbling with the bonsai suspiciously,

maybe he hid something there.
