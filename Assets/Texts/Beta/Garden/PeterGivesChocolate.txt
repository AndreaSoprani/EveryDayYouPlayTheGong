Hi, so Willy asked you to search for his stuff? That's typical of him... He would lost his head if it haven't been attached to his body...

Apart from be a very messy person, after Old Ben decided to prevent Willy from using the vending machine,

Willy have started to hide all his snacks because of the fear that they would be confiscated...

By the way yesterday while I was meditating near the pond I sat on this. Maybe it's what you're looking for...

Willy is often in the library, I suggest you to search there if you have to find other stuff.

Oh I was forgetting! Lately I also saw Willy in the east corridor fumbling with the bonsai suspiciously,

maybe he hid something there.
